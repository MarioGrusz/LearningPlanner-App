## Learning planner 

Application created from scratch by using HTML, SCSS and Vanilla Javascript.

Simple tool to organise learning activity, you can create category (e.g. arabic language), add task/s and time you want to spent on every task (e.g. verbs 20 minutes, vocabulary 5 minutes etc.), focus and learn. 

One of the most important reasons you should use this app is that it will help you stay organised.
